One operating function is device management. The function of device management is to keep track of all devices. It does this by using a task known as the I/O controller. it does a number of things from deciding whic process gets the device for how much time and when to allocating device effciency. 
Another operating function is File management. File management is basically your organizer it keeps everything nice and neat in usually a directory that is easy to navigate. It keeps track of information, uses, location, and status. It also decides who gets what resources and allocates and de-allocates resources. 
Another is Processor management. This is a big one because it decides which process gets the processor and how long long. in the sense of the operating system, the processor management keeps track of processor and status of process. Allotcates the CPU to a process and de-allocates the CPU when a process no longer needs it.
